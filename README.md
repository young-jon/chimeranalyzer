# ChimerAnalyzer (2012)

I wrote this for Johns Hopkins Hospital during my residency in 2012. I have learned a lot about how to structure code and write documentation since this project and don't use really big functions for everything anymore :) 

## Bone Marrow Engraftment Analysis
ChimerAnalyzer automates bone marrow engraftment analysis. After stem cell transplant, it is important to monitor the amount of donor and recipient cells in the bone marrow. This helps physicians diagnosis graft rejection, relapse, and failure. The software opens a GUI allowing the user to upload files corresponding to test results from donors and recipients. After all files are uploaded, the user clicks the big 'EVALUATE' button and bone marrow engraftment analysis is run on the files. Results are saved and/or displayed on screen.

I wrote up the results in a paper that ultimately was never submitted. 

See AnnualLecture3_new.pdf for a brief presentation I gave at the Univeristy of Maryland Medical Center about ChimerAnalyzer.

I presented this work as a poster at the Association for Molecular Pathology 2012 Annual Meeting in Long Beach, CA.
